## About CSS Implementation

The page style is based on Tron Legacy and overall neon style, these are some remarkable designs in the code:

- Background is implemented to appear as "the grid", using two linear-gradients.
- All page boxes and buttons are implemented to appear as classic mineswepper style boxes but make use of the color pallete of Tron.
- Shadows in texts are used to give the sensation of Neon lights.
